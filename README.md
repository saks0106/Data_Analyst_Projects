# 🚀 About Me
## Hi, I'm Sakshem! But you can call me Sam 👋
I'm a Data Analyst who aspires to know everything about the Data!. 

I have done my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from St.Xaver's College, Autonomous, Mumbai in 2016. After trying almost all the job profiles available in the market, I settled down for one....Government Job but again didn't work for me because of multiple reasons.
Until last year, little did I know about this amazing field of Data Science & in particular Data Analyst profile. The profile & work culture inspires me to be Successful and grow in the field, ready to learn new Technologies and Skills to upgrade my old ones. You know they say:

## The Projects:

As a Future Data Analyst & a Goal to be Successful in Data Science Field, here are few core projects which are mandatory to be a Good Data Analyst( according to Online Research)

I have worked on different technologies throughout my Academic and Professional Career but inorder to make a Good Career as a Data Analyst, I had to bring in all my wisdom gained throughout many years together to make these projects possible.


## Projects Description 

#### Project 1: Power BI

**Data Visualization**: We all know how important it is to communicate through Visual Representation as non techincal people like Stakeholders, Management, Common Viewers won't take into consideration boring looking Tables & Graphs. 

Data Visualization helps to tell stories by curating data into a form easier to understand, highlighting the trends and outliers thus making a long lasting impression in the minds of the Viewers. 

#### Personal Take:
I personally enjoyed learning about Business Intelligence tools like Power BI the most. The few courses which I took from Udemy to learn this skill taught me alot about the Data itself, **ETL Process**, linking two database based on 1 to Many Relationships, Cardinality, Creating Amazing **Measures** & **Columns**, Learning Various New **BI Functions** & Finally the Visualization Itself through Various tools


#### Why Power BI:
I liked the Power BI internal mechanism like Power Pivot, DAX Langauge, Interactive Dashboards and Ease of doing any given tasks which made me choose Power BI as my goto BI tool

#### The BI Project:
Sago Coffee House or Simple Sago is a small coffee chain across NewYork City having multiple stores. As they are now expanding their business even further, they need some who can give current and future insights about the data & take necessary actions. They hire Sam who is a Data Analyst and an amazing Story Teller. 

This projects revolves around Sam's Daily routine & how he helps the business to tackle challenges and eventually make the Sago coffee house grow every day.

#### Project 2: Deep Learning

**Deep Learning**: Deep Learning is used were traditional Machine Learning Models fail or give Very Low Accuracy or Very High Error. In any case, if project requires the use of any form of Neural Network, Deep Learning is the preferred choice. The Advantages of Deep Learning method of Prediction are immence compare to Machine Learning. The Advantages are as follows:

            1.Almost every line of code can be tweaked based upon our needs and requirements. 
            2.Easy to use Deep Learning libraries like Tensorflow with Keras
            3.Options like Transfer Learning like Feature Extraction, Fine-Tuning, Scaling are not avaiable for ML
            4.Various Callbacks to save and analyze our Model

The also has certain drawbacks which can't be ignored. The Disadvantages are as follows:

            1.Training takes longer than usual as Every Neuron updates with Weights and Biases
            2.Very few dedicated and specific models are only available
            3.As every line of code can be tweaked based upon our needs and requirements, experimentation time also increases
            4.A Good working knowledge is required to tweak changes

#### Personal Take: 

I like Deep Learning more than Machine Learning because of the above advantages. Also there is so much more to know and learn as new technologies keep on emerging.
   

#### The Deep Learning Project:
The Project: Sago wants to enhance Customer Experience even further. The task is simple: When the Customer enters the resturant, they are introduced to many food dishes & in most cases they would be unaware of it but willing to try the dish. Sago's CEO wants a mobile application wherein when the User clicks the photo of the food dish, the application tells which dish it is & all the necessary information along with it to make the Customer try it once.

Sam the inhouse Data Scientist & Deep Learning Expert is called upto for this task. His task is to gather all the images of different food items, prepare and train Deep Learning Models based on varying images of food items having different quantities and qualities.

#### Project 3: Excel

**Excel**: We know how popular excel is since its inception. I haven't found a business who doesn't use Excel(or similar technology). So, to be an Excellent Data Analyst, this tool needs to be mastered(or atleast the foundations and beyond needs to be strong). 

#### Personal Take:
I have been using Excel since my School days to do basic calculation. My previous job heavily relied on this tool & other MS Office products to get the job done. Building spreadsheets, calculations via various functions, Graphical Representation of Data etc were some the most commom use cases.


#### The Excel Projects:
The Excel projects which I made are a series of intermittent spreadsheets covering High Level aspects of Excel like Pivot Tables, Graphs & Charts & VBA Macros. The main intension of these multisheet projects is to cover all required skills like **Productivity**, **Formatting**, **Formulas**, **Visualization**, **Pivot Tables**, **Analytics**.

#### Project 4: Machine Learning

**Machine Learning**: Machine Learning in Data Science has become popular these days as it allows the user to feed a computer algorithm an immense amount of data and have the computer analyze and make data-driven recommendations and decisions based on only the input data.

#### Personal Take: 
I order to know Data Science, knowledge of few Python libraries are needed like **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Matplotlib**, **SKLearn** for Models along with **Deep Learning** library like **Tensorflow with Keras**. **I do have a working knowledge on all these libraries** mentioned & have used these wherever possible in by Data Analyst Projects

I have also made a few projects based on Machine Learning as well as Deep Learning. Few of them Include:

    1.Machine Learning:
        Classification Problem: Heart Disease Classification, KickerStarter Classification
        Regression Problem: BullDozer Price Prediction, Flight Price Prediction

    2.Deep Learning:
        Using different Convolutional Neural Network & various model techniques to Predict the Food Dish
        Using Recurrent Neural Network to Classify if a tweet has Disaster vibe or not


#### Why Machine Learning:
Learning & Using Machine Learning Tools let's the user Predict or Classify on Unseen Data based on Previously Trained Data which is quite revolutionary

#### The ML Project:
Kickstarter Projects is a platform where Entrepreneurs can post their projects or business ideas and try and get funded from other people. The Chances of someone investing in such projects is quite dicey as such projects have very little chance of getting funded. We call upon Sam who is a Data Analyst & has knowledge of Machine Learning as well. 
Sam is told to classify projects based on the State of being Successful & Failure so that a decision can be made if we should fund that project or not. Sam develops the model keeping in mind the below 4 questions and he tries to answer them.

    1.Which category has the highest success percentage? How many projects have been successful?

    2.What project with a goal over 1,000 USD, had the biggest Goal Completion % (Pledged / Goal)? How much money was pledged?

    3.Can we identify any trends in project success rates over the years?

    4.As an investor, what types of projects should you be looking at to guarantee future success?

#### Project 5: SQL

**SQL**: SQL with different RDBMS has always been a goto option to get Clear and Accurate Data for Prediction, Classification or Analysis.

#### Personal Take: 

I started by Journey with SQL during by Academic Days when I learned MS SQL Server for the 1st time. Learning about Databases & its Types, Data as a Commodity, Various RDBMS, Different Types of Keys,Operations Types, RDBMS specific functions, Joins, Groupby, ACID Properties, SDLC, ER-Modelling are some of the topics which I enjoyed learning the most and implementing these in our SQL Project
   

#### The SQL Project:
Sagober is the new affordable Travel Network & its growing fast but a challenge appeared has a Data Breach took place. Sam, who is a Data Analyst & a SQL Expert is called upon to handle the situation. With the help of few hints and Database Access, Sam is able the save the day by narrowing down the culprit list from thousands to just 11.
